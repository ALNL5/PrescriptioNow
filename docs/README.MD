### A Note about Deliveries.JSX
This page does not implement the delivery back-end and gets none of it's data from there. It gets it directly from customers and pharmacy. Since we could not get the deliveries back-end to a workable spot, the front end page is incomlete and does not implement a 3rd-party routing service to get the most efficient route between many stops. The update function didn't work on pharmacy and customers, so I couldn't change the status of an order. This page implements 3rd-party data to get the coordinates based on each address.

### Addresses ###
If you decide to create a customer, please only create addresses in Seattle. It will be easier that way. Trust.
